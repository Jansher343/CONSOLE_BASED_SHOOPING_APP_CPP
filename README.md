OVERVIEW:

This project implements a simple e-commerce platform using object-oriented programming in C++. It features user management for customers and sellers, product management for various product types (furniture, electronics, clothing), and a shopping cart system for customers to add, view, and remove items. The platform allows sellers to add and manage their products, while customers can browse, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.
